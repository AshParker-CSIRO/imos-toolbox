S, comment                              = The flag_masks attribute is the same type as the variable to which it is attached, and contains a list of values matching unique bit fields. The flag_meanings attribute is defined as above, one for each flag_masks value. A flagged condition is identified by performing a bitwise AND of the variable value and each flag_masks value; a non-zero result indicates a true condition. Thus, any or all of the flagged conditions may be true, depending on the variable bit settings.
